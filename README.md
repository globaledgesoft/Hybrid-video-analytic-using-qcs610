# Hybrid-video-analytic-using-qcs610
This project is intended to build and deploy a hybrid video analytic application onto Turbo X (based on QCS610) open kit that streams video to the AWS Kinesis video stream using kvssink gstreamer plugin. The application also analyses the video stream that require low computation power at the edge and delegates the high computational analytic task to cloud.
